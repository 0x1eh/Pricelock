# TASK DESCRIPTION

## Part 1 (In-Person Interview)

During the interview, you should gather requirements from the interviewer for a feature that is planned for release (in reality, this functionality is already in production).
- When a user searches for tickets for dates that are not yet available for sale, we activate the Advanced Reservation service.
-  Now we want to add a second service that will be available at the same time. The working name of this service is Pricelock.
Advanced Reservation is the default service when tickets are not yet available for sale. It is similar to a regular ticket purchase, but the difference is that the tickets are not issued immediately — they will be
issued once they become available.
Pricelock is an add-on to Advanced Reservation that allows the payment to be split and extended over time, up until the moment the tickets are issued. In other words, Pricelock is provided not based on the route, train, fare, etc., but solely based on the search depth.

## Part 2 (Offline)

After the interview, you must prepare a Software Requirements Document (SRD), which should include
the following information:
1. The proposed User Flow
2. Operational Flow (Back Office)
3. High-level Wireframes / Mockups
4. A description of the feature (customer-facing / operational-facing)
5. Acceptance Criteria in free form
While preparing the final solution, you may use any tools, including any AI products (recommended).
When using AI, please attach screenshots/copies of your prompts.
